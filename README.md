This is the code for the HL7 IG publisher: a tool to take a set of inputs
and create a standard FHIR IG. The HL7 FHIR IG publisher does not provide 
an authoring environment - that's left to other parties.

## Building this Project

This project uses [Apache Maven][Link-Maven] to build. To build:

```
mvn install
```

Note that unit tests will run, but are currently not set to fail the build as they do not all pass. This is being worked on.

To skip unit tests:

```
mvn -Dmaven.test.skip install
```

## Running this Project

Once built, this project produces an executable publisher jar file: `org.hl7.fhir.publisher.cli/target/org.hl7.fhir.publisher.cli-X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT.jar`. Detailed documentation on its features and common use cases are located in the [Confluence Documentation](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/IG+Publisher+Documentation), including instructions on how to run the publisher from your IDE.

In addition, two common publishing tasks that can be accomplished using the fhir-ig-publisher are described in detail in the documentation below:

* [Publishing Packages](https://hl7.github.io/docs/publishing_packages)
* [Publishing Templates](https://hl7.github.io/docs/publishing_templates)

## Releases

The built binary for the FHIR IG publisher is released through [GitHub releases][Link-GithubReleases] and can be downloaded directly [here][Link-GithubZipRelease].

## CI/CD

All intergration and delivery done on Azure pipelines. Azure project can be viewed [here][Link-AzureProject].

* **Pull Request Pipeline** is automatically run for every Pull Request to ensure that the project can be built by maven. [[Azure Pipeline]][Link-AzurePullRequestPipeline] [[source]](pull-request-pipeline.yml)
* **Master Branch Pipeline** is automatically run whenever code is merged to the master branch and builds the SNAPSHOT binaries distributed to OSSRH [[Azure Pipeline]][Link-AzureMasterPipeline][[source]](master-branch-pipeline.yml)
* **Release Branch Pipeline** is run manually whenever a release is ready to be made. It builds the [release binaries](#releases) and distributes them to artifact repositories. [[Azure Pipeline]][Link-AzureReleasePipeline][[source]](release-branch-pipeline.yml)


A brief overview of our publishing process is [here][Link-Publishing].
